My Personal Website 


## Goals for this website:

I wanted to redo my personal portfolio website as a way to keep my content organized. Some of the requirements I've set for myself include:

- Be server sided for first load and then have webpages cached to provide a quick user experience
- Get experienced with docker
- Get experienced with firebase or another database
- Use React (next.js) to provide a way to bring in styled components and create my own in the future
- Be able to support showing off videos and photos
- Add a way for clients to login and see their work and stats (create a user login page)
- Have a blog area to be able to have an outlet for writing in the future

## Technologies

Since I wanted to integrate a lot of different technologies to get familiar, I wanted to list them below to get more experienced with them

- Use React and show off my skills that I've gained
- Use Next.js instead of Gatsby because I'm able to take advantage of server side rendering 
- Docker to create a container based item to be rendered over AWS/Google cloud/Digital Ocean
- Node.js
- NGINX
- Django to store thing (try out firebase on a different project)
